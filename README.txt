This computer vision practical notebook has been made by Thomas CLÉON.

To use it you will need to install python 3.6 or later
We recommend to install anaconda to install your python. This way you can create a virtual environnement.

Once anaconda is install remember to add anaconda to your system path and conda as well. 

Then you will need to install : matplotlib, astropy, numpy, opencv, scipy, scikit-image

I RECOMMEND YOU TO CREATE A ENVIRONNEMENT TO USE THIS NOTEBOOK : 
To do so use the command :  conda create --name name_envs

Then : Launch your environnement

To do that : conda activate name_envs

To do that you can use the command : conda install -c conda-forge matplotlib, astropy, numpy, opencv, scipy, scikit-image


Once the installation is complete, go to the repertory of the notebook and use the command jupyter notebook in terminal. You can then open the notebook tp_computer_vision_1.ipynb
